## Overview

ToteTracker is a comprehensive storage tracking application designed for Android devices. It creates a local SQLite database on your device to maintain a complete inventory of all your storage containers and their contents, making it easy to find items when you need them.

Whether you're organizing a garage, storage unit, or just trying to keep track of seasonal items, ToteTracker provides intelligent tools to categorize and locate your belongings efficiently.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Local SQLite Database**: All data is stored locally on your device for privacy and offline access
- **Container Management**: Track multiple storage containers with unique QR code identification
- **Item Cataloging**: Add, edit, and search for items with detailed descriptions and images
- **Database Backup**: Export and import your database using your device's built-in sharing options

### Smart Categorization
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Automatically name and classify objects using Google Gemini AI image analysis
- **Barcode Scanning**: Alternative to AI analysis using the [UPCItemDB API](https://www.upcitemdb.com/) for product identification
- **Image Storage**: Item photos are stored as base64-encoded strings directly in the database

### Container Tracking
- **QR Code Integration**: Scan stickers created by the [QR Sticker Generator](https://github.com/ThatMattCat/qr-sticker-generator)
- **Visual Organization**: Keep track of which items are in which containers
- **Search Functionality**: Quickly find items across all containers

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Flutter SDK**: Version 3.0.0 or higher
- **Dart SDK**: Included with Flutter
- **Android Studio** or **VS Code** with Flutter extensions
- **Android SDK**: For Android development
- **Git**: For version control

### API Keys (Optional but Recommended)

- **Google Gemini API Key**: For AI-powered image analysis and automatic item categorization
  - Sign up at [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
  - The app will function without this, but you'll miss out on automated categorization

## Installation

### Option 1: Clone and Build from Source

1. **Clone the repository**:
